<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Betty is an older lady living in sheltered housing managed by a housing association.  She is frail and showing symptoms of dementia but normally able to live without daily assistance. Weekly wellbeing checks were part of the care plan. As a backstop to the wired pull-cord system, the housing association had replaced a normal double power socket in her kitchen with a Kemuri intelligent socket.</p>

<h2>The Issue</h2>
<p>One day Betty lost all sense of time, possibly owing to a mini-stroke. She started making meals in the middle of the night, constantly moving around the kitchen. She did not call for help by calling the scheme manager or pulling the emergency cord.  </p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>Kemuri’s web app alerted the scheme manager to the unusual amount of movement and the electricity used for the kettle or cooker. She received a text message the next morning. Betty was visited immediately and the manager called for medical assistance to restore normality.  </p>

<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>Betty was able to continue living in her flat. Her care plan was changed to provide more frequent monitoring of daily activities.  </p>

<h2>What They Said</h2>
<blockquote>
	<p>We installed the Kemuri K-Socket to identify lack of activity, such as unattended falls. It can be tragic if people can’t call for help. We weren’t expecting hyperactivity – but it shows how useful it is to alert risk cause by unusual activity.</p>
