<p><a href="https://www.homeof2030.com/">Home of 2030</a>, a cross-departmental initiative funded by HM Government, is a design competition created to drive innovation in the provision of affordable, efficient and healthy green homes for all.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.homeof2030.com/get-involved/innovation-challenge/">competition</a>'s aim was to help develop commercial solutions to housing problems, improve homes and encourage energy efficiency in housing to help it play its part in combating climate change.</p>

<p>Kemuri's innovative sockets were seen to be enabling vulnerable people living alone to have more confidence in their environment and for families and carers to have peace of mind that they are living well.  By being a simple drop-in replacement for a regular power socket it is a simple way to improve existing housing.</p>
