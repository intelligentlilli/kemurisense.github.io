Kemuri’s founder, Dr Leonard Anderson, explained that the Government knows that longevity is a growing problem and they need innovative solutions.  He invented K-Sockets to help people to live independently by using machine learning.  They are a cost-effective way of reducing days in hospital, care visits and the high cost of residential care.  Busy families gain reassurance that older people are managing to eat, drink and move around as normal.  Kemuri automatically alerts risks of falls, dehydration and hypothermia.
