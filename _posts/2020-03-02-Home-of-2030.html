<p>Kemuri won the £10,000 prize for Inclusive Living in the Government’s cross-departmental challenge for Home of 2030 design competition. It aims to drive innovation in the provision of affordable, efficient and healthy green homes for all.</p>

<p>The Innovation Challenge competition asked applicants for innovative solutions for low
carbon homes in 2030 using smart and digital technology. Innovations had to fit into high
volume homes, with low environmental impact, and subsequently support independent
living as residents age. The judges found that Kemuri K-Sockets address all the challenge
themes and awarded the prize for ‘Inclusive Living’.</p>

<p>Speaking about the win, Dr Leonard Anderson, Founder and CEO, Kemuri said “I couldn’t be more pleased that Kemuri K Sockets have been recognised for an Innovation award. We believe that everyone who could be supported to live at home, should be able to do so and we’re proud that our service is regarded as innovative, sustainable and affordable.”</p>

<p>Kemuri K-Sockets are smart power sockets fitted with sensors for motion, power used, temperature and humidity. The idea is the brainchild of Dr Leonard Anderson who has decades of experience in technology and innovation. He founded Kemuri after the experience of seeing his mother’s health decline as she lived with dementia.</p>

<p>Dr Anderson continues “When my mother went through dementia, I realised how important the kitchen is to supporting a healthy life. We would find mouldy food in the cupboard, and we weren’t sure what the carers were doing.  In my experience, older people have very regular habits. In my mum’s case, her hand was even formed in the shape of holding a cup as she had so many cups of tea a day.”</p>

<p>Kemuri’s solution ticks the box of promoting healthy living within the home, is scalable and provides safe, independent living technology which checks on status every 15 minutes. If there is any risk relating to activity outside a loved one’s normal daily routine, a message will be sent to family and friends, via the app, text or email.</p>

<p>Homes are vital to our health and economy, with people spending 75% of their lives indoors.
According to housing charity Crisis, we need to build around 340,000 homes per year. Making new homes desirable to all demographics was a key focus of the Home of 2030 challenge, ensuring that homes can adapt to changing needs and work for an ageing society, allowing people to live at home longer.</p>

<p>The Innovation Challenge for products and systems was a precursor to the main Home of 2030 competition which was launched on 2 March 2020 by Housing Minister Rt Hon Christopher Pincher MP. It is being run in collaboration with the Design Council, the Ministry of Building Innovation and Education (MOBIE), the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and the Building Research Establishment (BRE).</p>

<p>Six shortlisted teams will each receive £40,000 to draw up detailed, site-specific plans for 100 homes in a growth area outside London. Three finalists will have the opportunity to partner with developers to deliver homes on a site owned by Homes England.
This follows the government’s recent consultation on a new Future Homes Standard, which would require all new homes built from 2025 to have 80% fewer carbon emissions.</p>
