            <h2>The Issue</h2>
            <p>People admitted to hospital after a medical emergency with hypothermia, malnutrition or dehydration have poorer health outcomes.  Treatment may have to delayed, treatment is longer and discharge is delayed.  All add to NHS and Social Care costs.  </p>
            <img class="full-width-for-retina" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/episode.png" />
            <p>On average the NHS saves £5000 per patient discharged to own home rather than residential care.</p>
            <p>For example, the emergency could be an unattended fall, a stroke or diabetic coma.  Preventive monitoring, with improved wellbeing, means that quicker treatment, better outcomes, earlier discharge and reduced costs.  It could also avoid the need for transfer into residential care.</p>

            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>Commission KemuriSense Smart Power Socket for the kitchens of people who reject wearables, don't accept changes to their established routines and are beginning to decline in their activities of daily living.  With consent, engage the families of the vulnerable people to check the Kemuri Wellbeing Monitor once or twice a day.</p>

            <p>Families understand the daily routines and will take action if they have a concern about changes from normal patterns of activity.  They need peace of mind, and will help to sustain independent living.  If they identify an emergency, medical treatment is more likely to be successful and ensure better outcomes.</p>

            <p>Kemuri also has the option to send alerts to authorised people, such as next of kin, sheltered housing wardens or alarm response centres. This should follow all your normal protocols for commissioning care.</p>

            <p>Activities of Daily Living are well researched.  Encouraging people to prepare their own hot meals and to keep active all help to delay rapid decline.  Involving families in wellbeing monitoring reduces the overall cost of health and social care of the ageing population.  </p>

            <p>Most older people prefer to be supported their own homes.</p>

            <p>KemuriSense Smart Power Sockets are professionally installed in the kitchen by accredited telecare or housing maintenance suppliers.  The first is Welbeing, a growing telecare service company with 100 existing contracts with Local Authorities and the NHS.  With consent, family members are given access to the Kemuri Wellbeing Monitor app.  Consent could also be given to professional carers to perform a regular wellbeing check using the app - it’s only a few seconds a day.</p>
            <p>People with mild cognitive impairment continue living normally with nothing extra to remember, but with non-intrusive monitoring by families and carers.  SMS alerts can be sent after a few hours with more changes than normal - which could indicate an unattended fall or medical incident that needs emergency care.</p>

            <h2>Reablement Monitor</h2>
            <p>KemuriSense has a portable Reablement Monitor designed for instant deployment by people without any electrical skills.  It plugs into any power socket, in any room, for immediate measuring up to 13 amps of power, motion, temperature and humidity.  This is ideal as a temporary wellbeing monitor after discharge from hospital and assessment by OTs or Social Services.  The plug can be secured from disconnection by one of the standard plug safety covers.  Once a package of care has been determined, the portable version could be replaced by the permanent installation of a wall mounted version.  </p>

            <h2>Telecare &amp; Ethics</h2>
            <p>Kemuri technology is installed in the homes of vulnerable people who have been assessed to need increasing level of care.  It passively monitors multiple sensors and learns daily patterns of activity for predicting what is likely to happen in the next hour.  When routines aren't kept, or unusual activity happens at an unexpected times, alerts can be set to families, carers or 24/7 response centres.   </p>
            <p>Newcastle University, Institute for Ageing, reviewed the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/papers/Kemuri-Ethics2.pdf">Ethics of Passive Wellbeing Monitoring</a> and concluded that any concerns should be balanced against the likelihood of improved outcomes.  A focus group of carers of dementia sufferers, confirmed that <i>“ethical concerns were  minimal in comparison to the practical pressure, risks and anxieties involved in remote caring.”</i></p>
