            <h2>The Issue</h2>
            <p>Managers of sheltered housing have an implied duty of care to their residents.  They provide an environment where people want to continue live safe independent lives as long as possible.  The biggest risk is people falling and being unable to call for help, it is hugely traumatic and can lead to poorer health outcomes, lack of confidence and inability to return to independent living.  Second is impact of ceasing tenancies, refurbishment and finding new tenants. In the worst case scenario, people tragically die unattended after a fall that has not been identified by family, friends, carers or housing providers.</p>

            <p>Many types of people are at risk, who could be any age.  Examples are people with learning disabilities, dementia, epilepsy and sight loss, or wheelchair-bound, recently discharged from hospital or with a history of falls.</p>

            <p>Dehydration, malnutrition and living in cold, damp conditions also increases the probability of falls and poor health.  Together they increase the cost to housing providers, health services and social services - plus the stress to families and friends.  </p>

            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>Install KemuriSense Smart Power Sockets in the kitchens of vulnerable people.  Kemuri continuously analyses motion, power usage, temperature and humidity for changes in patterns of activity.   It also reports loss of electrical power.  They are “fit and forget” because all control and calibration is done via the Internet.  Services can be stopped and started remotely to suit the needs of residents. </p>

            <p>The system checks for significant changes every hour.  Housing managers can be alerted if there have been more than a reasonable combined number of changes.  Alternatively, or additionally, alerts can be sent to family, carers or telecare response centres.</p>

            <p>People use their kettles and microwaves as normal. KemuriSense® smart power sockets measure motion, temperature, power usage and power supply. Data is sent continuously to the Internet without using broadband and even during power cuts. Non-stop operation, even during a power cut when other devices might fail.</p>

            <h2>The Benefits</h2>
            <p>Accommodation with pre-installed KemuriSense Power Sockets is more attractive to prospective residents and their families. They know that hourly monitoring can be switched on immediately, or some time in the future, for less than the cost of a cup of coffee a day.  How much is peace of mind worth to people who care?  It’s an added value service that can be added to service fees.</p>

            <p>Wardens can make daily checks without having to visit properties and can schedule routine activities more effectively. Longer tenancies with healthier people benefits everybody.  </p>
