            <h2>The Issue</h2>
            <p>It’s a fact of life that people grow older and the general fear is that accidents and illnesses involving elderly loved ones may go undetected for days, or even weeks. Knowing that family members are safe, healthy and active is imperative. Are they keeping warm, eating, drinking and moving around as normal?

            <p>With families now widely dispersed, everybody needs reassurance of their loved one’s wellbeing, without frequent or unwelcome and intrusive phone calls. That’s where we come in.</p>

            <h2>Our solution</h2>
            <p>With our app, families, friends or carers can check on a loved one’s wellbeing whenever they like, wherever they are, simply by installing the KemuriSense Smart Power Socket.</p>

            <p>The KemuriSense Smart Power Socket looks like a regular plug socket, but it monitors daily and hourly indicators of a person’s wellbeing and can react when things don’t look quite right. It’s a great fit for those who object to the reminder of their increasing frailty by wearing an alarm pendant or something similar on their person.</p>

            <h2>Smart Monitoring</h2>
            <p>Kemuri provides reassurance with passive sensors and predictive monitoring. It’s designed to learn daily patterns of activity and can predict what should happen in the next hour. For example, if Grandpa has his morning tea at 7am every day, but on one morning doesn’t make it, Kemuri can notify everyone who is concerned for his welfare. It’s likely there’s no problem. But isn’t it good to be sure?</p>

            <p>People use their kettles and microwaves as normal. KemuriSense® smart power sockets measure temperature, power usage, motion, and power supply. Data is sent continuously to the Internet without using broadband and even during power cuts. Non-stop operation. It’s common sense.</p>

            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>KemuriSense Smart Power Sockets are designed to be professionally installed in the kitchen.  There’s no change in lifestyle once a loved one has one. There’s nothing to remember and no intrusive monitoring. It works like a standard double power socket and smart software checks activity every hour, identifies changes and keeps everybody informed via the Internet. Nothing could be simpler.
