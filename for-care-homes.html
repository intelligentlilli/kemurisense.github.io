            <h2>The Issue</h2>
            <p>People admitted to hospital after a medical emergency with hypothermia, malnutrition or dehydration have poorer health outcomes.  Treatment may have to delayed, treatment is longer and discharge is delayed.  All add to NHS and Social Care costs.</p>
            <img class="full-width-for-retina" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/case-study-timeline-dark.png" />
            <p>For example, the emergency could be an unattended fall, a stroke or diabetic coma.  Preventive monitoring, with improved wellbeing, means that quicker treatment, better outcomes, earlier discharge and reduced costs.  It could also avoid the need for transfer into residential care.</p>

            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>Commission KemuriSense Smart Power Socket for the kitchens of people who reject wearables, don't accept changes to their established routines and are beginning to decline in their activities of daily living.  With consent, engage the families of the vulnerable people to check the Kemuri Wellbeing Monitor once or twice a day.</p>

            <p>Families understand the daily routines and will take action if they have a concern about changes from normal patterns of activity.  They need peace of mind, and will help to sustain independent living.  If they identify an emergency, medical treatment is more likely to be successful and ensure better outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>KemuriSense Smart Power Sockets are professionally installed in the kitchen by accredited telecare suppliers.  The first is Welbeing, a growing telecare service company with 100 existing contracts with Local Authorities and the NHS.  With consent, family members are given access to the Kemuri Wellbeing Monitor app.  Consent could also be given to professional carers to perform the regular wellbeing review - it’s only a few seconds a day.</p>
            <p>People with mild cognitive impairment continue living normally with nothing extra to remember, but with non-intrusive monitoring by families and carers.  SMS alerts can be sent after a few hours with more changes than normal - which could indicate a fall or collapse that needs emergency care.  Nothing could be simpler.</p>

            <h2>Technology and Ethics</h2>
            <p>Kemuri technology is installed in the homes of vulnerable people who have been assessed to need increasing level of care.  It passively monitors multiple sensors and learns daily patterns of activity for predicting what is likely to happen in the next hour.  When routines aren't kept, or unusual activity happens at an unexpected times, alerts can be set to families, carers or 24/7 response centres.   </p>
            <p>Newcastle University, Institute for Ageing, reviewed the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/papers/Kemuri-Ethics2.pdf">Ethics of Passive Wellbeing Monitoring</a> and concluded that any concerns should be balanced against the likelihood of improved outcomes.  A focus group of carers of dementia sufferers, confirmed that “ethical    concerns were  minimal in comparison to the    practical pressure, risks and anxieties involved in remote caring.”</p>
