            <h2>The Issue</h2>
            <p>Many people who need telecare do not want the hassle and stigma of wearing a pendant alarm.  Research shows that 32% of pendant alarms are never even worn once, yet the UK provides 1.6 million of them, wasting £80m per year.

            <p>For these 500,000 people who reject wearables and don't accept changes to their established routines, there is still a need for monitoring</p>

            <h2>Our solution</h2>
            <p>The KemuriSense Smart Power Socket looks like a regular plug socket, but it monitors daily and hourly indicators of a person’s wellbeing and can react when things don’t look quite right. It’s a great fit for those who object to the reminder of their increasing frailty by wearing an alarm pendant or something similar on their person.</p>

            <p>The phone app allows carers to check on an elderly person's wellbeing and be alerted whenever there are too many changes from expected behaviour</p>

            <h2>Smart Monitoring</h2>
            <p>Kemuri is designed to learn daily patterns of activity and can predict what should happen in the next hour.  When routines aren't kept, or unusual activity happens at an unexpected time, alerts can be set to relevant carers to investigate.  This means a more efficient use of increasingly stretched care resources.</p>

            <h2>Treating a fall</h2>
            <p>Around <strong>50% of all people over the age of 80</strong> will have a fall in any given year.  If a patient arrives at A&amp;E in a dehydrated state it can delay surgery by up to a week.  So consider two situations, one without monitoring (i.e. refuses pendant alarms) and one with a KemuriSense socket.</p>
            <img class="full-width-for-retina" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/case-study-timeline.png" />
            <p><strong>Without monitoring</strong> - a fall may not be spotted for days.  A fall may be a result of dehydration and malnutrition that went undetected.  As a result, surgery is delayed, will have a worse chance of success, and may mean that returning home is not an option.  This may have knock-on effects for bed blocking.</p>
            <p><strong>With KemuriSense</strong> - changes in eating and drinking will have been spotted early, so even when a fall happens, the person won't be in poor health on arrival at hospital.  Faster surgery with a better chance of success means a greater probability of being able to return home, avoiding the costs associated with long hospital stays.
