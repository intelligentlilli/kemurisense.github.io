# Kemuri old Fonts

The k-icons was generated at http://fontello.com/ and is a small set of glyphs that we use on the website

If we need to update and add new icons, regenerate the entire thing at fontello, then replace the /fonts/k-icons.*
files in the website.

This can be done from the config.json file that is in this folder.

1.  install node.js if it's not already installed
2.  install the fontello CLI with the command
	> npm install fontello-cli -g
3.  download the fonts in this directory with the command (this will create a new subdirectory!)
	> fontello-cli --config ./fontello-config.json install
4.  copy the .ttf, .woff and .woff2 files into this directory
5.  delete the subdirectory



# New West Hill Fonts

Are the fonts in the two subdirectories.  When we move over, we will only require these fonts
