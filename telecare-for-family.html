            <h2>Who Needs Wellbeing Monitors?</h2>
            <p>All families with an older generation can benefit from Kemuri.  Families caring for frail or vulnerable people living alone need to identify falls and illness that may otherwise remain undetected for days. </p>
            <p>Families find out when when loved ones are not able to reach the kitchen, and drink, eat and keep warm as normal.  Families get automatic alerts and peace of mind for less than the price of a cup of coffee a day.</p>
            <p>Most people want to live independently as long as possible. Kemuri benefits those who:
              <ul>
                <li>Don’t realise the increasing risks of falls, stroke or diabetic coma  </li>
                <li>Forget normal activities of daily living</li>
                <li>Don’t wear their pendant alarms or fall monitors, and can’t call for help  </li>
                <li>Resent daily contact by care visits or phone calls they consider unwelcome or intrusive</li>
                <li>Have widely dispersed families who can’t make daily visits to check on wellbeing</li>
              </ul>
            Families can now receive Kemuri alerts and take immediate action.</p>

            <h2>Why hourly monitoring?</h2>
            <p>Older people tend to have regular patterns of activity during the day.  Use of kettles and cooking appliances can be predicted by Kemuri’s machine learning system.  It checks every hour for changes from normal patterns.  Alerts are sent as soon as the number of changes in a day is significantly higher than normal.  Nobody should be left unattended for more than a few hours.</p>

            <p>Families can view every hour for a week on a Smartphone App.  The day changes colour to red when an alert is sent.  An amber day is a possible early warning after a moderate number of changes.  </p>

          <div class="col-md-12">
            <table class="changes-explanation">
              <thead><tr><th colspan="2">Colour</th><th>Hour</th><th>Day</th></tr></thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr class="green"><th>Green</th><th><span class="swatch"> </span></th><td>No changes</td><td>Few changes</td></tr>
                <tr class="amber"><th>Amber</th><th><span class="swatch"> </span></th><td>One change</td><td>Moderate changes</td></tr>
                <tr class="red"><th>Red</th><th><span class="swatch"> </span></th><td>Two or more changes</td><td>Many changes</td></tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>For example, if Grandpa normally makes his breakfast at 7am every day and one morning he doesn’t make it.  Kemuri just flags the missed use of his kettle and lack of movement in the kitchen - not an alert.  Maybe he just wanted to lie in after watching a film the night before, and there’s no problem.  But if he also misses his morning coffee and lunch, then you will be alerted.  </p>

            <p>Timely family action could save a life, avert a long hospital stay and help to retain independent living.</p>

            <p>People use their kettles and microwaves as normal.  KemuriSense® smart power sockets  measure motion, temperature, power use,  humidity and mains supply.  Data is sent continuously to the Internet without using broadband and even during power cuts.  Non-stop operation.  It’s common sense.</p>

            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>After consent, you arrange for a KemuriSense Smart Power Socket professionally installed in the kitchen.  It unobtrusively replaces a standard double power socket where a kettle is normally used.  The older person continues to live independently with no change to lifestyle.   There’s nothing for them to remember and no intrusive monitoring. </p>
            <p>You log in to Kemuri Wellbeing Monitor App once or twice a day and check for activity changes at any time.  You can also get SMS alerts after a few hours of a lot more changes than normal.  You might be able to identify an accident, such as a fall that needs medical attention.</p>
            <p>Nothing could be simpler.</p>
