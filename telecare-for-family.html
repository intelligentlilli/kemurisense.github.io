title: Smart monitor for Grandma or Grandad in their home
permalink: /telecare-for-family/
excerpt: The KemuriSense smart power socket allows nonintrusive monitoring of a loved one, and can notify families and carers when there is an unexpected change in behaviour, but without pendants or other worn monitoring devices

        <p>Living independently at home for as long as possible is most people’s understandable goal. </p>
        <p>But caring families do worry. </p>
        <p>What if older or disabled friends or relatives are not feeling well – but keeping it to themselves? Perhaps they’re awake at night, or not going out, or too uncomfortable to eat or drink. You could keep calling to check up on them, but no one wants to feel like a spy. And nobody wants to spied upon.</p>
        <p>What if the worst happens and they have a fall or a medical emergency and no one knows for hours – or tragically for days? Giving your loved ones pendant alarms only works if they actually wear them. And proud people can feel like they’ve been labelled as a disaster waiting to happen. </p>
        <p>Or what if your loved ones have been in hospital and need extra support at home in getting back to normal?</p>
        <p>How can you know?</p>

        <h2>An intelligent way to care</h2>
        <p>What’s needed is a more effective way to watch over our older and less able family and friends, quietly and unobtrusively. </p>
        <p>That’s exactly our mission at Kemuri.</p>
        <p>We’re committed to helping people live safely and confidently in their own homes.  That includes those living with dementia. Our technology works in the background, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. We alert you as soon as we know there might be problem. You can respond to alerts and give the support that’s needed. You decide whether it’s only a quick phone call or a more urgent visit. </p>

        <h2>What’s different?</h2>
        <p>It’s the automatic alerting. Every 15 minutes Kemuri checks that normal routines are being maintained. Are kettles switched on for early morning tea? Have carers arrived to heat up meals at lunchtime, or have cookers been used for evening meals? </p>
        <p>You can schedule an alert each morning if there has not been any movement in the kitchen since 7pm the previous evening.  </p>
        <p>You can monitor as many people as you like at the same time. They could be older relatives, or other adults living independently with mobility challenges or learning difficulties. </p>
        <p>As well as receiving alerts, you can manually monitor activity at any time of the day or night quickly and easily - without having to interrupt anybody’s daily life. You can see when appliances are being used, or check that when someone’s gone out for the day they have returned home safely. You then choose whether to get in touch with people to find out if there have been any problems.</p>
        <p>And it’s all possible through the wonders of intelligent power sockets. </p>

        <h2>Plug in and go</h2>
        <p>Start with the Kemuri extension sockets. Simply plug them into wall sockets before plugging in kitchen appliances used for eating and drinking, such as kettles, coffee makers, microwaves and toasters.  Kemuri sockets collect information round the clock. They measure electricity used, people moving around in the kitchen, power failure, room temperature and humidity. </p>
        <p>If your loved ones prefer not to have extension sockets on the worktop, then there are wall-mounted versions. The benefit of wall-mounted sockets is that they can’t be accidentally turned off. </p>
        <p>It’s life as normal for your loved ones at home.</p>

        <h2>Alerter app</h2>
        <p>The brilliance of Kemuri is the alerter app. It learns how your relatives normally use their appliances and automatically sends alerts to you by email or text as soon as it calculates unusually high numbers of changes in the day. You don’t have to do anything apart from making sure you have your smartphone handy.   </p>
        <p>You decide if an alert is a cause for concern and how to respond. Get in touch with your loved one, contact a neighbour, speak to a carer or warden, or even call emergency services. </p>
        <p>Many people now have busy life styles and can’t find the time for daily checking. There’s absolutely no need for you to watch and monitor, but you can if you like. </p>
        <p>Any number of responders can view one person. Any approved viewers can monitor any number of loved ones. You can make arrangements for who gets automatic alerts or switch them off at any time.  </p>
        <p>Privacy is assured. Kemuri is collecting sensor data from somebody’s home. It can’t be shared unless they have agreed who has permission to view.  </p>
