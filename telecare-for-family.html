            <h2>The Issue</h2>
            <p>It’s a fact of life that people decline in their old age and that accidents and illness may go undetected for days, or even weeks.  You want to know that your loved ones are safe, healthy and active every day.  Are they moving around, keeping warm, eating and drinking as normal?</p>
            <p>Perhaps they are proud, and don’t realise the increasing risks of falls, stroke and diabetic coma.  They don’t wear their pendant alarms.  Perhaps they are forgetting things - but they resent being reminded by frequent, unwelcome and intrusive phone calls.
            <p>With families now widely dispersed, they can’t make daily visits to check  on wellbeing and take immediate action in emergencies. </p>

            <h2>Your solution</h2>
            <p>Simply arrange for the installation of a KemuriSense Smart Power Socket in the kitchen. Then all your family, friends or carers use the Kemuri app to check on the older person’s wellbeing, whenever they like, wherever they are.</p>

            <p>The Kemuri Wellbeing Monitor shows daily and hourly indicators of unusual patterns of activity and you react when things don’t look quite right.  You can prevent the trauma of loved ones not being able to call for help for more than a few hours.  You can improve their health outcomes with faster treatment and perhaps they may be able to return home more quickly.</p>

            <h2>Living independently</h2>
            <p>Research shows that the decline in activities of daily living can be delayed by timely interventions.  Kemuri automatically tracks changes from normal, but you can see what extra support may be needed to keep somebody mobile, warm, eating and drinking to support their safe independent living.</p>
            <p>For example, if Grandpa normally makes his breakfast at 7am every day, but one morning he doesn’t make it.  Kemuri flags the missed use of his kettle and lack of movement in the kitchen.  You see this when you look at the app screen at 8am.  Maybe he just wanted to lie in after watching a film the night before and there’s no problem.  But isn’t it good to be sure?</p>

            <p>People use their kettles and microwaves as normal.  KemuriSense® smart power sockets  measure motion, temperature, power use,  humidity and mains supply.  Data is sent continuously to the Internet without using broadband and even during power cuts.  Non-stop operation.  It’s common sense.</p>

            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>After consent, you arrange for a KemuriSense Smart Power Socket professionally installed in the kitchen.  It unobtrusively replaces a standard double power socket where a kettle is normally used.  The older person continues to live independently with no change to lifestyle.   There’s nothing for them to remember and no intrusive monitoring. </p>
            <p>You use the Kemuri Wellbeing Monitor App once or twice a day to check for activity changes at any time.  You can also get SMS alerts after a few hours of a lot more changes than normal.  You might be able to identify an accident, such as a fall that has not been reported for medical care.</p>
            <p>Nothing could be simpler.</p>
