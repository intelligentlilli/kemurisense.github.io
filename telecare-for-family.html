            <h2>Who Needs Wellbeing Monitors?</h2>
            <p>All families with an older generation can benefit from Kemuri.  Families caring for frail or vulnerable people living alone need to identify falls and illness that may otherwise remain undetected for days. </p>
            <p>Families find out when when loved ones are not able to reach the kitchen, and drink, eat and keep warm as normal.  Families get automatic alerts and peace of mind for less than the price of a cup of coffee a day.</p>
            <p>Most people want to live independently as long as possible. Kemuri benefits those who:
              <ul>
                <li>Don’t realise the increasing risks of falls, stroke or diabetic coma  </li>
                <li>Forget normal activities of daily living</li>
                <li>Don’t wear their pendant alarms or fall monitors, and can’t call for help  </li>
                <li>Resent daily contact by care visits or phone calls they consider unwelcome or intrusive</li>
                <li>Have widely dispersed families who can’t make daily visits to check on wellbeing</li>
              </ul>
            Families can now receive Kemuri alerts and take immediate action.</p>

            <h2>Why hourly monitoring?</h2>
            <p>Older people tend to have regular patterns of activity during the day.  Use of kettles and cooking appliances can be predicted by Kemuri’s machine learning system.  It checks every hour for changes from normal patterns.  Alerts are sent as soon as the number of changes in a day is significantly higher than normal.  Nobody should be left unattended for more than a few hours.</p>

            <p>Families can view every hour for a week on a Smartphone App.  The day changes colour to red when an alert is sent.  An amber day is a possible early warning after a moderate number of changes.  </p>

          </div>

          <div class="col-md-12">
            <table class="changes-explanation">
              <thead><tr><th colspan="2">Colour</th><th>Hour</th><th>Day</th></tr></thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr class="green"><th>Green</th><th><span class="swatch"> </span></th><td>No changes</td><td>Few changes</td></tr>
                <tr class="amber"><th>Amber</th><th><span class="swatch"> </span></th><td>One change</td><td>Moderate changes</td></tr>
                <tr class="red"><th>Red</th><th><span class="swatch"> </span></th><td>Two or more changes</td><td>Many changes</td></tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>For example, if Grandpa normally makes his breakfast at 7am every day and one morning he doesn’t make it.  Kemuri just flags the missed use of his kettle and lack of movement in the kitchen - not an alert.  Maybe he just wanted to lie in after watching a film the night before, and there’s no problem.  But if he also misses his morning coffee and lunch, then you will be alerted.  </p>

            <p>Timely family action could save a life, avert a long hospital stay and help to retain independent living.</p>

            <h2>What are Kemuri benefits?</h2>
            <p>For older people, Kemuri Smart Power Sockets carry no stigma.  They look like ordinary, familiar, power sockets.  Just plug in kettles, microwaves, toasters or any other cooking equipment with no change to normal activity.  With hourly monitoring, they live safer in their own homes for longer.</p>
            <p>For families, you can reduce the trauma of loved ones not being able to call for help.  You can improve their health outcomes with faster medical treatment and enable them to return to independent living with hourly checking.</p>

            <h2>Is Kemuri simple to install?</h2>
            <p>Yes.  Simply plug the portable version into any power socket.  Everything else is automatic.  It immediately starts sending data to the Internet from internal sensors for motion, electrical power, room temperature and humidity.  A built-in SIM card means it works without broadband.</p>

            <p>The alternative fixed version replaces a standard double power socket.  It is ideal for ensuring permanent connection to the power supply; it cannot be switched off.  Both units operate for 18 hours during power failure and alert power loss </p>
