            <h2>Who Needs Wellbeing Monitors?</h2>
            <p>All families with an older generation can benefit from Kemuri. Vulnerable people living alone may have falls or illnesses that may remain undetected for days and they can suffer from life-threatening dehydration, urinary tract infections or hypothermia. They may not be able to reach the kitchen for drinking and eating as normal and be unable to call for help.</p>

              <li>Don’t realise the increasing risks of falls, stroke or diabetic coma  </li>

              <li>Don’t wear their pendant alarms or fall monitors, and can’t call for help  </li>
              <li>Resent daily contact by care visits or phone calls they consider unwelcome or intrusive</li>
              <li>Have widely dispersed families who can’t make daily visits to check on wellbeing</li>

            <p>Families can now receive Kemuri alerts and take immediate action.</p>

            <h2>Why hourly monitoring?</h2>
            <p>Older people tend to have regular patterns of activity during the day.  Use of kettles and cooking appliances can be predicted by Kemuri’s machine learning system.  It checks every hour for changes from normal patterns.  Alerts are sent as soon as the number of changes in a day is significantly higher than normal.  Nobody should be left unattended for more than a few hours.</p>

            <p>For example, if Grandpa normally makes his breakfast at 7am every day and one morning he doesn’t make it. Kemuri just flags the missed use of his kettle and lack of movement in the kitchen - not an alert. Maybe he just wanted to lie in after watching a film the night before, and there’s no problem. But if he also misses his morning coffee and lunch, then any selected people will be alerted.
</p>

            <p>Timely family action could save a life, avert a long hospital stay and help to retain independent living.</p>

            <h2>What are Kemuri benefits?</h2>
            <p>For older people, Kemuri K-Sockets carry no stigma.  They look like ordinary, familiar, power sockets.  Just plug in kettles, microwaves, toasters or any other cooking equipment with no change to normal activity.  With hourly monitoring, they live safer in their own homes for longer.</p>
            <p>For families, you can reduce the trauma of loved ones not being able to call for help.  You can improve their health outcomes with faster medical treatment and enable them to return to independent living with hourly checking.</p>

            <p>Yes. Simply plug portable K-Sockets into any power socket. Everything else is automatic.

Built-in SIM cards means they work without broadband and internal batteries provide 18 hours back-up if there is a power cut.</p>

            <p>Although simple to install, they are also simple for users to switch off and trigger unnecessary alerts that cause concern. In such cases it is prefereable to replace them with alternative fixed versions, known as Wellbeing Monitors.</p>
