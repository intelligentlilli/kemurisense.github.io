        <h2>The Issue</h2>
        <p>The demand for acute hospital beds is forever increasing. Some of these beds
          are occupied by patients who cannot be safely discharged without reablement
          care packages, which could require daily care visits. They may occupy a bed for
          several days until Social Services can commission domiciliary care and visits
          from family who live nearby.</p>

      <div class="col-md-10 col-md-push-1">
        When people are living alone, possibly with mild cognitive impairment, they are at
        risk of falls, dehydration, malnutrition, hypothermia and other chronic medical
        conditions. Many vulnerable people do not have family or social networks that
        can undertake daily checks of wellbeing. Without prompt medical attention, they
        may have to be readmitted to hospital with consequent poor health and wellbeing
        outcomes. Readmission increases the probability that patients have to be
        discharged into costly residential care homes.

        <p>A secondary problem is with traditional pendant alarms. Most people do not
          wear them continuously and they may have falls when unable to reach their push
          button or a telephone to call for help. As many as 30% never wear them, often
          leaving them on bedside tables.</p>

      <div class="col-md-5 col-md-push-1">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>You can commission portable K-Sockets that monitor service user kitchens every
hour of the day. After the first week of reablement, Kemuri automatically alerts
major changes to patterns of daily activity. Family or carers receive email or text
alerts before deciding what action, if any, is needed. Additionally, Kemuri can
send alerts to 24/7 alarm response centres that are commissioned to respond a
wide range of alarm calls.</p>

        <p>Secondly, you can trial our prototype K-Fobs. Unlike traditional pendant alarms,
they also monitor movement and temperature. Families or carers can be alerted
that K-Fobs are not being worn and that there is a risk of hypothermia. No
competitive products that can do this with a five-year battery life.</p>

        <p>Neither product requires any installation skills. People can be discharged with a
          reablement packages that contain portable K-Sockets and K-Fobs*.
          * Note: K-Fobs need connection to the Sigfox network, which is being rolled out
          nationally.</p>

        <h2>What Next?</h2>
        <p>Plan a project for adding Kemuri technology into local health and care pathways.
            Start with discharge and reablement processes to assess the impact on health
            and care budgets and outcomes.</p>

        <p>After reablement and assessment, offer service users long-term wellbeing
          monitoring. Under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/care-act-statutory-guidance/care-and-support-statutory-guidance">Care Act Guidance</a> , everyone whose needs are met by local
          authorities, must receive personal budgets as part of a care or support plan.
          Following the financial assessment, the overall cost must be broken down into
          the amount people must pay and the remainder of the budget that councils will
          pay.</p>

        <p>Recommend fixed K-Sockets for wellbeing monitoring. They replace double
          power sockets in kitchens, permanently connected to mains power supplies.
          Service costs are lower, but subject to an installation cost. K-Fobs are suitable
          for both reablement and wellbeing periods. Encourage families and friends to
          organise first response to alerts. This could reduce demand on contracted 24/7
          alarm response services.</p>
