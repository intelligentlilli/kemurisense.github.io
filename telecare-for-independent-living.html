        <h2>Improving resident support intelligently at lower cost</h2>
        <p>- The challenge for housing associations is to provide the right level of support within limited budgets</p>
        <p>- Housing schemes need to look at where costs are high, and in many cases that means the cost of teams providing daily care calls and visits to tenants</p>
        <p>- Want to deliver a high-quality service but need to make it more cost-effective</p>

        <h2>Bringing greater efficiency to care calls</h2>
        <p>-  At Kemuri we offer a service that helps you achieve your goals </p>
        <p>- We help you reduce the number of calls and visits to tenants without losing sight of your responsibility as managers</p>
        <p>- It’s an innovative approach to keeping people safe at home by remotely and accurately monitoring their kitchen activity around the clock through intelligent power sockets </p>
        <p>- When there’s a significant change in the use of daily appliances, that’s when alerts are sent out by text or email, and that’s when you know your tenant may need help</p>
        <p>- It’s fast, it’s reliable and it reduces your overall costs</p>

        <h2>Minimising the cost of false alarms</h2>
        <p>-  Up to 90% of alarms are false [please could you explain what sort of alarms we’re talking about here just to be clear]</p>
        <p>- That’s a huge unnecessary strain on your resources when you have to respond to every alarm</p>
        <p>- Thanks to Kemuri’s multiple sensors and intelligent algorithms, you’ll only get alerts that matter </p>
        <p>- So you can focus efforts where calls and visits are a priority</p>
        <p> [link]  Read more [about Kemuri sockets and how they work – rather than explaining in any more depth on this page as we already have 5 blocks we can go to the K-sockets page]</p>

        <h2>Rewiring the future</h2>
        <p>-  The analogue network will close in 2025</p>
        <p>- That means much of today’s alarm technology will be obsolete [again, can we give examples of the type of alarms this will affect?]</p>
        <p>- Rewiring to adapt to new networks will be expensive and disruptive </p>
        <p>- You can futureproof your services now with wireless Kemuri, delivering intelligence through the power supply network</p>
        <p>- Greater accuracy and reliability of monitoring without the costs of rewiring</p>

        <h2>Putting families at the centre of care</h2>
        <p>-  Help families support their loved ones</p>
        <p>- With Kemuri, families and friends can be nominated to receive alerts as well as, or instead of, housing scheme teams</p>
        <p>- So families can take over management of monitoring and respond to alerts any time</p>
        <p>- They get peace of mind </p>
        <p>- And it’s a great step forward in a successful relationship between you, your tenant and their supporters [bit of fluffy stuff as promised]</p>
