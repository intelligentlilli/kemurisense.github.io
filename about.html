				<p>Our name comes from the Japanese word for 'smoke', and is meant to hark back to one of the many ways by which help would be given last century in the UK</p>

				<p>In streets of houses before central heating became a standard, every household would fire up their stove to heat water, to warm the kitchen, to cook breakfast.  Every house would have a little plume of smoke coming from the chimney.  By that signal alone, neighbors could know that people were going about their daily lives and all was well.</p>

				<p>When a house unexpectedly stopped making that smoke, someone could pop over and see if there was a problem that the person needed help with, without needing to intrude every day </p>
